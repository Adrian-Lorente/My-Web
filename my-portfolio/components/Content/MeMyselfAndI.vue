                I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at UC3M, building this website to practice, 
                trying out new technology and being creative in the proccess (or that's the intention at least). 
                This will be a long-term project, which I'll be working on whenever I have time (not too much theese days, pretty busy with uni).
                The final goal is to make this site kind of my personal space, where I share my hobbies, interests and proyects.
