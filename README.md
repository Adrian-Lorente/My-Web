# My-Web

In this repository, I will be creating my own Website using the framework `Nuxt3` for vue along with `Bootstrap`.
This will be a long term project, so I don't expect to finish it until near the end of summer. 

I'll be using it to practice, and at the same time because I wanted to create my own space/portfolio.
