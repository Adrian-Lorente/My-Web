# My-Web ðŸ‘½

In this repository, I will be creating my own Website using the framework `Nuxt3` for vue along with `Bootstrap`.
This will be a long term project, so I don't expect to finish it until near the end of summer (mostly due to Uni and vacations). 

I'll be using it to practice, and at the same time because I wanted to create my own space. Whenever I feel like it is good to go, I'll be using GitHub Pages feature to host my page and paste the link here once I have it.

# âœ… Update v1.0 6/8/2023

The first version of the website is partially done now. There are still some things left to do, such as making it responsive, as well as multi-browser, for a decent navigation in all devices, cleaning the code, adding elements to make it prettier (pics, fonts...) and lastly, adding more sections.

# âœ… Update v1.1 9/11/2023 

This is the first version I will use in Github Pages. It is fairly responsive, simple and has a the basics of what I want to show. I'll add more features in the future
